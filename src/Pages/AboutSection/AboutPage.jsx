          I am a passionate junior web developer with over two years of
          experience in learning and building web applications. I have skills in
          front-end and back-end development, with expertise in HTML5, CSS3,
          JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.js, Express.js, and
          Node.js. I enjoy creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces using
          Tailwind, Material UI, and Bootstrap, while ensuring seamless
          functionality with MongoDB and Firebase on the back end.
          <br />
          <br />I am committed to constantly learning and growing as a
          developer, and I'm excited to bring my skills to real-world projects.
          Although Iâ€™m just starting out professionally, my enthusiasm for
          coding drives me to continually improve and stay up to date with the
          latest technologies.
